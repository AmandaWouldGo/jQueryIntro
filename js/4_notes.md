#### Basic functions?
  - $() -- This is the jQuery selector
  - $(document).ready() -- Get your scripts ready to run.
  - $.on() -- This way to binding event delegation.
  - $.ajax() - Want more internet than your JS script contains..? AJAX and you're there.

#### Basic jQUery Workflow:
 find *something*
 do *something*

 BEWARE:
 Chrome devtools defines $ as well. This is not jQuery.

## The DOM

DOM === Document Object Model

Harnessing the power of jQuery will give you unprecedented control over the DOM with the kick ass benefit of writing way less code along the way.

jQuery DOM features include:
  - HTML/DOM manipulation
  - CSS manipulation
  - HTML event methods
  - Effects and animations
  - AJAX
  - Various utilities

#### AJAX

Specifically for AJAX, jQuery has its own flavor of AJAX which happens to be the flavor we teach @DBC. Being good with jQuery selectors is 3/4 of the battle when writing your jQuery flavored AJAX. The AJAX pattern itself is fairly simple. The selection and manipulation of DOM elements using jQuery around an AJAX call is the tricky bit.
